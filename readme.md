Data Structures
===============

This repo is a place for me to practice writing different data structures in different languages. 

This is a work in progress for me to cement in my understanding of different data structures and keep
my skills fresh in the different languages I know. 

Where possible, I try to simulate the native behavior of the language. 
For example, pop in Python takes an argument that says what index to remove, but in JavaScript,
pop's argument is how many elements to remove off of the end. 

Languages I eventually plan to include: 
* Python
* JavaScript
* Java
* Ruby

Data structures to include: 
* Dynamic Array
* Hash
* Linked List
 - Singly
 - Doubly
* Stack
* Queue
* Deque
* Set
* Binary Search Tree
 - Breadth First Search
 - Depth First Search
  * Pre-order Traversal
  * Post-order Traversal
  * In-order Traversal
* Trie (Prefix Tree)
* Heap (Priority Queue)
* Graph
* Linked Hash Map
* Disjoint Set
